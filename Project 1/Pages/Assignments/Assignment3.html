            <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
            <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Biryani can be described as a Persian pulao which met the rich spices and herbs of the subcontinent to
                create the original Mughlai biryani, for which yogurt was made into a thick paste with traditional
                Indian spices, garlic, onions and almonds, and then used to marinate the meat
            </p>
            <h2>RECIPE</h2>
            <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The ingredients known to improve the flavors of Biryani include saffron (kesar), fried onions, ghee,
                Kewra water, and rose water. Each of them adds a unique flavor, texture, and smell to the dish.</p>
